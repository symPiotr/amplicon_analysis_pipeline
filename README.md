# The recommended Symbiosis Evolution Group amplicon analysis workflow
Here we provide the details of the custom amplicon data analysis workflow developed in December 2020 by Diego Castillo Franco, Michał Kolasa and Piotr Łukasik.
We recommended this pipeline for the use by the Symbiosis Evolution Group at the Institute of Environmental Sciences of Jagiellonian University.
The instructions are primarily intended for group members and associates, especially those who work on one of the institutional computing clusters - but we intend to make them broadly accessible.

Most of the key steps described below will be described in separate documents within this repository... ultimately. It will also contain the key scripts, or links to scripts. But it is work in progress!

To follow these steps effectively, you should have basic familiarity with the Unix command line and sequence analysis.
